      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Tejasvi Garg</strong>, a passionate web developer
        currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Applications (MCA). I have a
        strong foundation in front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects,
        such as a portfolio website and a social media application. These
        experiences have taught me the importance of creating user-friendly and
        responsive designs. In addition to web development, I have a keen
        interest in mobile app development, particularly with React Native and
        Flutter. I'm constantly striving to enhance my skills and stay updated
        with the latest technologies. When I'm not coding, I enjoy shooting
        vlogs and sharing my journey on YouTube. I also love exploring new tech
        trends and participating in online coding challenges. Looking ahead, I
        aspire to work in a dynamic tech environment where I can contribute to
        impactful projects and continue to grow as a developer. If you're
        interested in collaborating or just want to chat, feel free to connect
        with me!
