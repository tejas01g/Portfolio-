        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Tejasvi Garg</strong>, a passionate web developer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA). I have a strong foundation in front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        
        <p>Over the past few years, I've worked on several projects, including a portfolio website and a social media application. My experience has taught me the importance of creating user-friendly and responsive designs.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to web development, I have a keen interest in learning mobile app development, particularly with React Native and Flutter. I'm constantly seeking to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest technologies.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy shooting vlogs and sharing my journey on YouTube. I also love exploring new tech trends and participating in online coding challenges.</p>
        
        <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to work in a dynamic tech environment where I can contribute to impactful projects and continue to grow as a developer. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat, feel free to connect with me!</p>
